I believe Murray's prediction of Internet TV and living virtual environment is successful, because with the rapid development of technology, there have been more and more virtual network and virtual environment, such as interactive games of Switch game console, VR technology display and so on. While most of these experiences are visual at the moment, technology will evolve and others will follow. Murray's prediction is similar to the surreal virtual environment in which the mandalorian actors perform, a combination of procedural and participatory, immersive in virtual environments, virtual and real agents and transformations.The "real" feeling experienced by the actor and the audience in the production is different, because the actor is aware of the environment he is facing and the production process, they may always move in a fixed space, but the background and props are changing. But what the audience sees is a real transformation, a big world.
