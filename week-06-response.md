I agree with the problems and solutions laid out by Bridle. Because I think he's right about the impact of systems automation and systematization on people, especially children.Its effects are slow and intangible, especially fatal to a child who is absorbing and learning from the outside world.
You don't know exactly what it will instill in your child. Children need a healthy and colorful world, not a single one.

So this need to think about control, exactly these need to have both human and system control and check. It may be less efficient than being completely systematic, but it will keep the child "safe."
