Every coin has two sides. The same is true of games. Some games bring negative effects, but there are also many games that bring positive effects.

A good game includes too much content, movies, plays, music, role playing and so on. When we play a game, we are not only experiencing the content, but we are the content itself.

As the creators of the game, we can record, improve and supplement the game according to the needs of the surrounding environment. "Games have a unique capacity for improvisation!"

Editing a game is not the same in different hands, they can co-edit a better game, or they can compete to create a better game.
