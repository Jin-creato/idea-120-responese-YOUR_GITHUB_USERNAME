I haven't tried this yet, I don't know how hard it is, but I'll do it as well as I can.I actually saw this and played this game for the first time, but I thought it was fun.
If I had to do it, I'd like to do a word spoof game. I will try to guide the player to choose the options I set, and there will be music and pictures throughout the game as the player plays the game.
