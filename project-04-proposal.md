I haven't tried this yet, I don't know how hard it is, but I'll do it as well as I can.I actually saw this and played this game for the first time, but I thought it was fun.
If I had to do it, I'd like to do a word spoof game. I will try to guide the player to choose the options I set, and there will be music and pictures throughout the game as the player plays the game.

Jared's response:
When I think of a 'word spoof' game, my mind goes to the gameshow 'Password' or to a secret word or phrase that a player must guess to advance to the next round. One way I could imagine doing this is to have the player start from a vague high-level place and ask questions to drill down to what the word could be.

For example: "Is it a person or a thing?" could be a first question, and the choices could be "yes" or "no", and then "is the thing real or imagined?" etc, getting more specific as you get closer to what the thing is.

At the end, you could even have the user input/type in what they believe the word to be and then it could be checked against the real answer (if there is one...or it could just be accepted as the answer).

If you wanted to create something where the user inputs their answer and then checks it, you could use a solution like the one found here: http://twinery.org/questions/26657/user-input-and-other-things - the second post where they are doing "error checking" on the name being used. Be sure to watch the Tutorials I assigned, specifically the one on Variables in twine (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3zGvR4S27c) for more information on using variables (stored data that changes based on the state of the story or input from the user).

Excited to see it!
