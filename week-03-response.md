Linguistic message (Articulated (written) language.)

A coded iconic message (It eludes signification insofar as the advertising nature of the image is essentially functional: to utter something is not necessarily to declare / am speaking, except in a deliberately reflexive system such as literature.) 

A non-coded iconic message (Literal message.)
